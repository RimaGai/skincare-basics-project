        <h3>Morning ðŸŒž</h3>
        <p>
          The main point of the morning routine is to prepare your skin for the
          day.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Step 1 - Cleanse</strong>
          <br />
          Cleansing is the first step of any good skincare routine. Any cleanser
          milk/balm/gel is fine.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Step 2 - Acid tone </strong>
          <br />
          Acid toners contain low levels of ingredients such as salicylic acid,
          glycolic acid and lactic acid. Applied to the face on a cotton pad,
          they help to remove dead skin cells, even out skin tone and promote
          collagen production. If you have sensitive skin, or you are using
          acids for the first time, start by uing them twice a week and see how
          your skin reacts.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Step 3 - Eye cream </strong>
          <br />
          The eye contour is very delicate and itâ€™s probably the first area to
          show signs of ageing as it has the thinnest skin on the face. So itâ€™s
          best not to rub your eyes.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Step 4 - Serum </strong>
          <br />
          Choose your serum depending on your concerns, such as dull skin, fine
          lines or uneven texture, there are numerous types to choose from.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Step 5 - Moisturise </strong>
          <br />

          Moisturiser keeps your skin hydrated and helps strengthen your skin
          barrier. Choose your moisturiser by your skin type, not condition.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Step 6 - SPF </strong>
          <br />
          This is the most important step in your skincare routine. Harmful UV
          rays affect your skin 365 days a year. Even when it's cloudy and even
          when you're inside. It's therefore important to protect your skin
          every single day by always using a cream formulated with a
          broad-spectrum sunscreen rated SPF 30 or higher.

        <h3>Evening ðŸŒ™</h3>
        <p>
          The main point of your evening routine is to help your skin help
          itself. Repair and correct.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Step 1 - Double cleanse</strong>
          <br />
          If you are wearing make up and/or SPF you should double cleanse. Use
          oil/balm cleanser first to remove make up and SPF (use flannel to
          remove the cleanser) and then go in with your regular milk/gel
          cleanser to clean the skin.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Step 2 - Acid tone </strong>
          <br />
          The same as during the morning routine, unless you are planning on
          using a vitamin A product now.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Step 3 - Eye cream</strong>
          <br />

          The same as during the morning routine.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Step 4 - Treat</strong>
          <br />

          This should be your main expense skincare-wise. Try and have at least
          3 products you can mix up and use depending on your skinâ€™s needs such
          as a good facial oil, a good serum/treatment. Whether or not you use a
          night-time moisturiser is dependent on what treatment you use. If your
          treatment is IN your moisturiser, youâ€™re done. If you are using a
          lovely night-time oil you may not want/need anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Optional - Mask</strong>
          <br />
          If you have the time and like to indulge, consider applying a mask
          once or twice a week after cleansing and before your other nighttime
          routine steps.
